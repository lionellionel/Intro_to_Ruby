The key to _VERB_ing out the parents is the clammy _PLURALNOUN_.
A lot of people will tell you that a phony _NOUN_ is a _ADJECTIVE_ _NOUN_,
but you get a _ADJECTIVE_ mother and you could _VERB_ up in a hospital,
and that's worse that high school.

You fake a _NOUN_ cramp and
while you're bent over _VERB_ing and _VERB_ing,
you lick your _NOUN_

It's a bit childish and _VERB_,
but then, so is _ADJECTIVE_ school
